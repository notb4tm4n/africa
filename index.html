    <main>
        <p>Africa is currently facing significant climate challenges. The continent is warming faster than the rest of the world, and this rapid warming is driving food insecurity, poverty, and displacement. Here are some key points about the current climate situation in Africa:</p>

        <h2>1. Increasing Temperatures</h2>
        <p>Africa is experiencing rising temperatures, with some regions already seeing over 1°C of warming. This trend is expected to continue, posing significant threats to human health and productivity.</p>

        <h2>2. Extreme Weather Events</h2>
        <p>The continent is witnessing more frequent and severe weather events, including devastating floods, droughts, and heatwaves. These events are becoming more common and intense due to climate change.</p>

        <h2>3. Glacier Loss</h2>
        <p>Africa's glaciers are melting rapidly, and it's predicted that the continent could lose all of its glaciers by the 2040s.</p>

        <h2>4. Desertification</h2>
        <p>The Sahara Desert is expanding at a rate of more than 11,000 km² per year, leading to increased desertification and loss of arable land.</p>

        <h2>5. Food Insecurity</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a key driver of food insecurity, affecting 20% of Africa's population. This is due to changing precipitation patterns and extreme weather events impacting agricultural productivity.</p>

        <h2>6. Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>African countries are losing 2-5% of their GDP annually due to climate change, and many are diverting up to 9% of their budgets to respond to climate-related disasters.</p>
